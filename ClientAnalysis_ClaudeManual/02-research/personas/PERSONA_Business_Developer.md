## Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Name** | Marko Novak |
| **Role** | Business Development / Sales |
| **Age** | 35-45 |
| **Experience** | 10+ years in tech sales/partnerships |
| **Tech Comfort** | Low-Medium |

> "I need to explain the value of this framework to potential clients without getting lost in technical details."

## Background

Marko has spent his career in technology sales and partnerships, building relationships with enterprise clients and identifying opportunities for the company's services. He understands business problems deeply but relies on technical colleagues to explain implementation details.

Recently, the Claude framework has become a key differentiator in sales conversations. Clients are interested in AI-assisted development, and Marko needs to articulate what makes this framework special. He's heard the framework creator explain it several times but struggles to reproduce that explanation without support.

Marko is frustrated that he can't independently explore the framework's capabilities. When a prospect asks "what can your AI framework do?", he either oversimplifies or has to schedule a follow-up call with technical staff.

## Goals

### Primary Goals
1. **Understand framework value proposition**: Grasp what the framework does at a high level to articulate it to prospects
2. **Find examples and success patterns**: Access case studies, examples, and proof points to share with potential clients

### Secondary Goals
1. **Reduce dependency on technical colleagues**: Answer basic framework questions without pulling in engineers
2. **Build confidence in AI conversations**: Feel comfortable discussing AI-assisted development with skeptical executives

## Frustrations

### High Priority
- **Knowledge Transfer Complexity** (PP-1.1): The training sessions with the framework creator are helpful but not scalable. Marko needs a reference he can return to on his own time.
- **Discoverability Challenge** (PP-1.3): When preparing for a specific industry pitch, he can't easily find relevant framework capabilities without asking for help.

### Medium Priority
- **Lack of Visual Organization** (PP-1.4): The framework's file structure means nothing to him. He needs business-relevant categories, not technical folder names.

## Day in the Life

### Morning (9:00 AM - 12:00 PM)
Marko reviews his pipeline and prepares for a discovery call with a potential client in the healthcare industry. He wants to mention how the Claude framework can accelerate their product development. He opens the framework folder but immediately feels overwhelmed by the technical structure. He sends a Slack message to the framework creator: "Hey, what should I mention about the framework for a healthcare company?"

### Afternoon (1:00 PM - 6:00 PM)
After the call (which went okay thanks to his quick Slack answer), Marko works on a proposal. He wishes he could include a polished overview of framework capabilities but doesn't know how to extract that from the raw files. He ends up using a screenshot from a previous presentation, hoping it's still accurate. At 5 PM, he joins a company showcase where he sees the framework in action - this helps, but he wishes he could explore it independently.

### Key Moments
- **Peak stress**: When a prospect asks a specific framework question he can't answer
- **Peak satisfaction**: When a deal closes partly because of the framework's perceived value
- **System touchpoints**: Before client calls, during proposal writing, when explaining company capabilities

## Technology Profile

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Primary Devices** | MacBook, iPhone (for quick reference during calls) |
| **Preferred Apps** | Salesforce, Slack, Google Slides, LinkedIn |
| **Pain with Tech** | Avoids command-line tools; prefers visual interfaces |
| **Learning Style** | Stories, examples, high-level explanations over technical depth |

## Quotes

> "I don't need to understand HOW it works, just WHAT it does and WHY clients should care." - On learning approach

> "Every time I want to mention the framework, I have to ask someone. That's not scalable." - On dependency

> "Show me a one-pager I can share with a prospect." - On what he needs

## Design Implications

| Area | Implication |
|------|-------------|
| **UI Complexity** | Simple, visual, minimal technical jargon |
| **Mobile Priority** | Medium - quick reference during client calls |
| **Training Needs** | Guided onboarding, curated "top 5 things to know" |
| **Key Features** | Value proposition summaries, exportable descriptions, search by business problem |
