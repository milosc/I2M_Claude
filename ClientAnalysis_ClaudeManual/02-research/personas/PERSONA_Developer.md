## Background

Stefan is a senior developer who uses the Claude framework daily for client implementation projects. He's already comfortable with the framework's core workflows - running `/htec-sdd-tasks` to decompose work, using `/htec-sdd-implement` for TDD-driven development, and leveraging multi-agent code review.

However, he frequently encounters situations where the framework's default behavior doesn't perfectly fit client requirements. For example:
- A client needs GDPR-specific validation rules that aren't in the default quality gates
- A medical device project requires FDA 21 CFR Part 11 compliance checks that need custom agents
- A fintech client wants a specialized code review agent focused on PCI-DSS security patterns

Stefan is more than capable of extending the framework - he just needs to quickly find the source files to edit. Currently, he spends 10-15 minutes navigating the `.claude/` folder structure to locate the right skill, agent, or command definition. He knows the files are somewhere in `.claude/skills/`, `.claude/agents/`, or `.claude/commands/`, but without file path references in the documentation, he wastes time hunting.

He's also interested in contributing improvements back to the framework - fixing bugs, adding features, and sharing custom agents with the team. But without clear documentation of where each component lives, the barrier to contribution is higher than it should be.

## Goals

### Primary Goals

1. **Quickly Locate Source Files for Customization** - Find and edit skill, agent, or command definitions within seconds instead of minutes. (Traces to PP-1.6)
2. **Understand Implementation-Stage Tools** - Identify which skills and agents are relevant for the implementation phase (TDD, code review, integration testing) versus discovery or prototype phases. (Traces to PP-1.4)
3. **Customize Framework for Client Needs** - Extend agents, modify quality gates, and add new skills specific to client domain requirements (e.g., healthcare compliance, fintech security).

### Secondary Goals

1. **Contribute Framework Improvements** - Fix bugs and add features to shared framework components, knowing his changes won't break other teams' workflows.
2. **Optimize Personal Workflow** - Bookmark frequently-used skills and commands so he doesn't have to search for them on every project. (Traces to PP-1.5)
3. **Understand Agent Coordination** - Grasp how multi-agent orchestration works so he can debug issues when parallel agents fail or produce unexpected results.

## Frustrations

### High Priority

- **Developer Friction** (PP-1.6): When he wants to customize a skill or agent, he has to manually navigate the file system to find the source. For example, if he's reading the documentation for the `quality-security-auditor` agent and wants to add a custom OWASP check, he has to:
  1. Remember that agents are in `.claude/agents/`
  2. Navigate to that folder
  3. Search for files matching "security" or "auditor"
  4. Open 2-3 files to find the right one

  This takes 10-15 minutes when it should take 10 seconds. He wants a "Copy file path" button next to every skill/agent/command in the documentation.

### Medium Priority

- **Organizational Chaos** (PP-1.4): Framework tools aren't visually organized by stage. When starting a new implementation project, he wants to see "just implementation-phase tools" instead of scrolling through discovery skills, prototype skills, and utilities all mixed together.

- **Lack of Personalization** (PP-1.5): He uses the same 10-15 skills repeatedly (TDD implementation, code review, quality gates) but has to search for them every time. He wants a "Favorites" feature where he can bookmark frequently-used tools for instant access.

### Low Priority

- **Missing Usage Examples for Advanced Features** (PP-1.2): Some advanced skills (like multi-agent orchestration or reflexion-based change requests) lack code examples showing how to customize behavior. He can read the frontmatter and instructions, but real-world examples would save time.

## Day in the Life

### Morning (8:00 AM - 12:00 PM)

Stefan starts his day working on a fintech client project that requires PCI-DSS compliance checks during code review. He knows the framework has a `quality-security-auditor` agent, but the default security checks focus on OWASP vulnerabilities, not PCI-DSS patterns like "no logging of credit card numbers" or "encryption in transit validation."

He opens the ClaudeManual (or VSCode) and searches for "security auditor." He finds the documentation, which explains what the agent does and how to invoke it, but there's no file path reference. He navigates to `.claude/agents/` manually, sees 30+ agent files, and opens three before finding `quality/security-auditor.md`.

After editing the agent to add PCI-DSS checks, he wonders: "Did I just break this for other projects?" He doesn't know if the agent is used globally or if he should create a custom agent instead. Without clear guidelines on when to fork vs. edit, he's uncertain.

This process takes 25 minutes when it should have taken 2-3 minutes.

### Afternoon (12:00 PM - 6:00 PM)

In the afternoon, Stefan runs `/htec-sdd-implement` to execute TDD development for a user story. The command works well, but he notices that the test framework is using Jest when the client project uses Vitest. He wants to customize the implementation developer agent to detect the project's test framework and adapt.

He searches for "implementation developer" in the manual but again finds no file path reference. He navigates to `.claude/agents/implementation/` and finds `developer.md`. While editing it, he realizes he's seen this pattern before - last week he customized the code review agent, and two weeks ago he edited a discovery skill.

He thinks: "Why isn't there a 'Copy file path' button in the documentation? Why do I keep navigating folders manually like it's 2010?"

By 4:00 PM, he's completed the customization, but he's frustrated by the repetitive file-hunting process. He knows the framework is powerful, but the developer experience for customization could be 10x better with simple UX improvements.

### Key Moments

- **Peak Stress**: 10:15 AM - Wasting 25 minutes hunting for a file when he has a sprint deadline in 2 hours.
- **Peak Satisfaction**: When he successfully customizes an agent, runs the command, and sees his changes work perfectly - validating that the framework is extensible.
- **System Touchpoints**:
  - VSCode (editing `.claude/` files)
  - Terminal (running framework commands)
  - GitHub (reviewing framework PRs, contributing improvements)
  - Slack (asking framework questions or sharing custom agents with team)

## Technology Profile

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Primary Devices** | MacBook Pro, dual monitors for code + documentation |
| **Preferred Apps** | VSCode, iTerm2, Git, Docker, Postman, Cursor (AI coding assistant) |
| **Pain with Tech** | Frustrated by inefficient workflows (manual file navigation, no keyboard shortcuts, missing copy-paste features) |

## Jobs to Be Done

### Functional Jobs

- **When I need to customize a skill or agent**, I want to copy the file path instantly, so I can open it in VSCode within seconds instead of navigating folders manually.
- **When I'm starting an implementation project**, I want to filter tools by "implementation stage," so I only see relevant skills and agents without scrolling through 115+ items.
- **When I use a skill frequently**, I want to add it to favorites, so I can access it with one click instead of searching every time.

### Emotional Jobs

- **I want to feel efficient** when working with the framework, not slowed down by repetitive file-hunting.
- **I want to feel confident** when customizing agents, knowing I won't accidentally break shared components.
- **I want to feel empowered** to contribute improvements back to the framework, not blocked by unclear contribution guidelines.

### Social Jobs

- **I want to be recognized** as a framework contributor who improves tools for the entire team.
- **I want to be seen as a framework expert** who can quickly customize agents for client-specific needs.
- **I want to represent high-quality engineering** by using the framework efficiently and professionally.

## Behavioral Model (Fogg)

### Motivation
- **Core Driver**: Maximize development velocity by using and extending the framework efficiently. He knows the framework can save 60-80% of manual work - if he can customize it quickly.
- **Pain Avoidance**: Stop wasting time on repetitive file navigation and manual documentation searches.
- **Aspiration**: Become the team's go-to person for framework customization and advanced features.

### Ability
- **High Technical Skill**: Can read and modify TypeScript, Python, and markdown files confidently.
- **Time Constraint**: Sprint deadlines mean he needs answers and file paths in seconds, not minutes.
- **Familiarity with Framework**: Already knows how skills/agents/commands work - he just needs better UX for finding and editing them.

### Triggers
- **Spark**: When a teammate shares a custom agent that perfectly solves a client-specific problem, proving the value of framework extensibility.
- **Facilitator**: File path references and "Copy path" buttons that eliminate manual navigation.
- **Signal**: Wasting 10-15 minutes on file hunting triggers frustration and desire for better tooling.

## Product Implications

| Area | Implication |
|------|-------------|
| **UI Complexity** | Developers are power users - they need advanced features like file path references, favorites, keyboard shortcuts, and quick copy-paste. |
| **Mobile Priority** | Low - Developers primarily work at desktop workstations with dual monitors. |
| **Training Needs** | Minimal - Stefan already understands the framework. He needs better UX, not training. |
| **Key Features** | File path references (PP-1.6), favorites (PP-1.5), stage-based filtering (PP-1.4), search (PP-1.3), keyboard navigation. |
| **Success Metric** | Reduction in time spent finding source files + increase in framework contributions (PRs, custom agents shared with team). |

## Design Implications

1. **File Path References are Critical**: Every skill, agent, and command in the manual must show its file path with a "Copy" button (CF-013, PP-1.6).
2. **Favorites Feature**: Allow developers to bookmark frequently-used tools (CF-012, PP-1.5).
3. **Stage-Based Filtering**: Show "just implementation tools" when Stefan is working on that phase (CF-011, PP-1.4).
4. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Developers expect `Cmd+K` for search, `Cmd+C` for copy, `Cmd+F` for in-page search.
5. **Code Examples**: Advanced skills should include real-world customization examples (e.g., "How to add a custom OWASP check to the security auditor").
6. **Contribution Guidelines**: Clearly document when to fork vs. edit shared components, and how to submit framework improvements.
