## Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Name** | Ivana Horvat |
| **Role** | VP of Engineering / CTO |
| **Age** | 42-52 |
| **Experience** | 15+ years in technology leadership |
| **Tech Comfort** | Medium (strategic rather than hands-on) |

> "I have 15 minutes to understand if this framework is ready for broader adoption. Don't make me dig through folders."

## Background

Ivana has risen through the technical ranks to lead engineering organizations. She evaluates technology investments, sets technical strategy, and makes decisions about tool adoption across teams. Her time is extremely limited, and she relies on her teams to surface the right information at the right abstraction level.

The Claude framework caught her attention after seeing initial results from an early-adopter team. She wants to understand its maturity, capabilities, and scalability before recommending broader investment. However, her attempt to explore the framework independently was frustrating - she opened a terminal, saw a wall of folders and files, and closed it.

Ivana needs to quickly assess: What can this framework do? How mature is it? What's the learning curve for my teams?

## Goals

### Primary Goals
1. **Understand framework capabilities at a glance**: Get a high-level overview without deep exploration
2. **Assess framework maturity**: Determine if this is production-ready or experimental

### Secondary Goals
1. **Evaluate adoption effort**: Understand the training and onboarding required for teams
2. **Identify strategic value**: See how this framework aligns with company goals around AI-assisted development

## Frustrations

### High Priority
- **Knowledge Transfer Complexity** (PP-1.1): The manual training approach doesn't scale. If adoption requires the creator to personally train each team, it's a bottleneck.
- **Organizational Chaos** (PP-1.4): The framework's structure is optimized for power users. Executives need a dashboard view, not a file explorer.

### Medium Priority
- **Lack of Visual Hierarchy** (PP-1.1): Without a clear visual overview, it's impossible to quickly grasp scope and capabilities.

## Day in the Life

### Morning (7:30 AM - 12:00 PM)
Ivana's morning is back-to-back leadership meetings. Between calls, she has 10 minutes to review materials for an upcoming decision: should the company invest in broader Claude framework adoption? She opens the framework documentation link but immediately sees raw markdown files. She doesn't have time to navigate and interpret - she forwards it to her technical lead with a note: "Can you give me a 5-minute summary?"

### Afternoon (1:00 PM - 6:00 PM)
After lunch with a board member discussing AI strategy, Ivana joins a framework demo session. This is helpful, but she wishes she could have gotten the same understanding in 5 minutes on her own. At 4 PM, she makes a provisional decision to fund a framework expansion pilot, but notes that documentation accessibility needs to improve before wider rollout. She asks: "How can someone new understand this in under 30 minutes?"

### Key Moments
- **Peak stress**: When asked to make a decision without clear, summarized information
- **Peak satisfaction**: When technology investments show measurable ROI
- **System touchpoints**: Review meetings, strategic planning, tool evaluation sessions

## Technology Profile

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Primary Devices** | MacBook, iPad for reading |
| **Preferred Apps** | Slack, Google Docs, dashboards |
| **Pain with Tech** | No patience for complex UIs or command-line tools |
| **Learning Style** | Executive summaries, visual dashboards, 5-minute overviews |

## Quotes

> "If I can't understand it in 5 minutes, it's a documentation problem, not a complexity problem." - On accessibility

> "Training bottlenecks kill adoption. Show me self-service." - On scalability

> "I need to see the forest, not count the trees." - On visualization needs

## Design Implications

| Area | Implication |
|------|-------------|
| **UI Complexity** | Dashboard-style overview, progressive disclosure |
| **Mobile Priority** | Medium - iPad reading during travel |
| **Training Needs** | Zero for basic overview; optional deep-dives |
| **Key Features** | Executive summary view, capability dashboard, maturity indicators, adoption metrics |
