## Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Name** | Dana Kovačević |
| **Role** | Delivery Manager / Client-Facing Engineer |
| **Age** | 32-38 |
| **Experience** | 6-10 years in consulting/delivery |
| **Tech Comfort** | Medium-High |

> "I need to show clients what our framework can do without spending hours preparing a demo."

## Background

Dana works at the intersection of technical delivery and client relationships. With a background in software engineering and project management, she transitioned to a client-facing role where she bridges the gap between what the team builds and what clients understand.

Her days are split between internal technical discussions with developers and external presentations to client stakeholders who range from technical architects to business executives. She's often the first person a client asks when they want to understand the Claude framework's capabilities.

Dana is comfortable with technical concepts but doesn't have time to dive deep into every framework component. She needs to quickly understand what tools exist, what they do, and when to recommend them to clients.

## Goals

### Primary Goals
1. **Demonstrate framework capabilities to clients**: Present professional examples and diagrams within minutes, not hours
2. **Find the right tools for client needs**: Quickly identify which framework components address specific client challenges

### Secondary Goals
1. **Build credibility with clients**: Appear knowledgeable and confident about the framework
2. **Reduce preparation time**: Minimize the time spent preparing for client demonstrations

## Frustrations

### High Priority
- **Discoverability Challenge** (PP-1.3): Cannot quickly search and filter to find tools relevant to a specific client situation. Wastes time browsing folders before client calls.
- **Organizational Chaos** (PP-1.4): Hard to explain the framework's structure to clients when components aren't visually organized by workflow stage.

### Medium Priority
- **Lack of Contextual Documentation** (PP-1.2): When clients ask "what does this do?" or "show me an example," there's no quick way to pull up integrated explanations with visuals.

## Day in the Life

### Morning (8:00 AM - 12:00 PM)
Dana starts her day reviewing emails and Slack messages from clients and internal teams. She has a 10 AM client call where she needs to demonstrate how the Claude framework handles product discovery. She spends 30 minutes trying to find the right skills to show, navigating through folder structures and opening multiple markdown files to piece together a narrative.

### Afternoon (1:00 PM - 6:00 PM)
After a working lunch with her delivery team discussing a new client engagement, Dana prepares a proposal that includes framework capabilities. She wishes she could easily export component descriptions and diagrams for the client-facing document. Instead, she manually screenshots and formats content from raw markdown files. At 4 PM, she joins an internal sync where she asks the framework creator about a specific command she couldn't understand from the documentation alone.

### Key Moments
- **Peak stress**: 15 minutes before a client demo when she can't find the right skill to show
- **Peak satisfaction**: When a client says "this is exactly what we need" after seeing a framework demonstration
- **System touchpoints**: Before and during client calls, during proposal writing, when answering client questions

## Technology Profile

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Primary Devices** | MacBook Pro, external monitor for presentations |
| **Preferred Apps** | Slack, Zoom, Google Slides, VS Code (light usage) |
| **Pain with Tech** | No time to learn complex tools; needs intuitive interfaces |
| **Learning Style** | Visual demonstrations, quick reference guides, examples over theory |

## Quotes

> "I shouldn't need to ask the framework creator every time a client has a question." - On self-service

> "Clients don't care about folder structures - they want to see capabilities and workflows." - On visualization needs

> "If I can't find something in 30 seconds, I'll just ask someone or skip it." - On discoverability

## Design Implications

| Area | Implication |
|------|-------------|
| **UI Complexity** | Clean, professional interface suitable for screen-sharing with clients |
| **Mobile Priority** | Low - primarily desktop for presentations |
| **Training Needs** | Minimal - interface should be self-explanatory |
| **Key Features** | Search, stage-based filtering, exportable diagrams, comparison views |
