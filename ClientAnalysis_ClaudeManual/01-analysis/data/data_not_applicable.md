## Reason

This folder is empty because **no spreadsheet files (xlsx, csv) were provided in Client_Materials**.

## Details

- **Expected Content**: Business rules extraction, field definitions, data validation patterns
- **Why Not Applicable**: Input materials contained only interview transcript
- **Source Decision**: discovery_materials_inventory.json shows 0 spreadsheets

## Impact

This does not affect the Discovery output quality because the interview transcript provides sufficient functional requirements for the ClaudeManual application.
