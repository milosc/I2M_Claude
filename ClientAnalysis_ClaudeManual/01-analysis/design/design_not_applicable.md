status: NOT_APPLICABLE

## Reason

This folder is empty because **no screenshot or design files (png, jpg) were provided in Client_Materials**.

## Details

- **Expected Content**: UI component inventory, navigation patterns, design tokens extraction
- **Why Not Applicable**: Input materials contained only interview transcript
- **Source Decision**: discovery_materials_inventory.json shows 0 screenshots

## Impact

This does not affect the Discovery output quality because the interview provides clear UI requirements (dual-pane interface, terminal aesthetic, light/dark themes). Design specs will be generated from these verbal requirements.
