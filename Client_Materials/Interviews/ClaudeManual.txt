Look I want you. I have a problem. I build a Claude framework for doing I to market with AI acclued olators build it cloud. And now I have to spread this knowledge to all my coworkers and just showing dot cloud skills. Folder command folder agents folder rules folder hooks folder et cetera. 
And the pro de pile. I want to have this very visual. So I want you to think about an Node JS app that has the ability to create markdown files through an. Or show markdown files that are in some relations and hierarchies. 
So like, you know, skills than commands than agents. And you can click if an agent says ISS using a command. If you click on command, it opens this command in a pain below. So there are like two pains. View. Master and Little Pain. 
And what one I want to achieve is that when you show when you click on a comment on a skill on an agent, it has multiple sections explaining the front matter, explaining why and for what is this agent skill or command. He then showing example how to run what are the options high level workflow diagram of this command agent of skills. 
So I want like this to be a searchable manual for the dot clod. So. I want this to have a search page. I want this to have text so I can take skills for myself that are useful. I can have the skills and commands and agents and rules could be labeled or TED so they could be organized visually into stages like we have in discovery, prototyping, implementation and utilities, video, you name it. 
So I can organize them and then just show the what I want. I want it to have like a concept of favorites. So everybody can say add to favorites and we move to favorites. So having commands that are on skills and an agent that are shortcut and those agent skills and commands should always have a reference where they are in route. 
So a given user could copy the pad and go edit the skills. So this is the product that I want you to realize try to use as clean as possible of a newi maybe some modern minimalistic terminal look like maybe I don't know you figure the consumers will be product people we build client partners, business developers develop secus. 
So you name it all the people involved in a typical idea to market process building an application as solution from idea to market. So make it appealing for everyone. It should have a white and black team as usual. 
And this is basically it. A go figure. You know, create me and a plan. How to build this solution.
