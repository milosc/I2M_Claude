# Original Feedback

I am missing the option to tag a given skill, agent and command with a tag, where i see existing ones plus add new ones. Can you add these features, as I believe these were mentioned in the client interviews.

## Source Validation

**CONFIRMED** - This feature was explicitly mentioned in client materials:

1. **JTBD-1.3**: Success criteria #3 states: "Can tag components (e.g., 'JTBD extraction', 'code generation')"
2. **CF-010 (Tagging system)**: Referenced in SCR-002 (Search Results Page) traceability
3. **ClientAnalysis_ClaudeManual/02-research/JOBS_TO_BE_DONE.md**: Line 90

## Feedback Classification

- **Type**: NewFeature
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Priority**: P1 (Important - significantly improves efficiency per JTBD-1.3)
- **Categories**: CAT-DISC, CAT-CODE, CAT-DATA, CAT-SCR, CAT-REG
